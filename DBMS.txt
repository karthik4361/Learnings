Database


Data - Any data to take business decisions
Base -  Collection of similar data at a place (ex: Airbase)

Database -  Collection of related data at a particular location

DBMS -> A software which helps us to do CURD operations	for/on database efficiently

SQL databases - Consistent - vertically scalable
NoSQL databases - Eventually consistent - Horizontally Scalable 

DBMS Supports indexing , cacheing and automatic query optimizer, storage engine (InnoDB for SQL this helps in efficient storage, handling fragmentation, maintain ACID properties)

Relation = Table =  Entity = Class 
Tuple = Row = Object 
Attribute = Column = Member Variables

NoSQL DB;

1, Document DB: Json is directly stored in database, each JSON is a row

Eg: MangoDB, DynamoDB

2, GraphDB: store graph like data like linked in data with connections

Eg:neo4G

3, ColomnarDB: instead of row wise column wise data is stored
â€” its fast because most time we will filter based on column or join by column and in column all data is of same type so we can decrease size of column by applying some casing techniques. So used in analytical purposes

Eg:  Cassandra, 

4.Key- value : similar to hash map
- Redis 


Keys:

Set of columns to uniquely identify a row.

Candidate key: keys with minimum size


Primary Key:
A candidate key which is chosen by by database administrator to uniquely identify a row

Tip : never use column which change as primary key.

Foreign key: Relationships in RDBMS are established using RDBMS 

Foreign key is  key is other table but exists in this table and defines a relationship 

Composite key: A primary key with size garter than 1
