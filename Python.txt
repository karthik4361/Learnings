Lambda functions are singe line  and  should return some value used when we need a function for less time and don’t need it later. 

Set - .add(element) adds element
	  .remove(element) removes element if found if not error
	  .discard(element) removes element if found if not it won’t raise error
All these are O(1) but in worse case of collisions in Hash table its O(n)
Dictionary : 
		.get(key, default) - will give you value for key in dict if key not present it will return the value we pass in default
