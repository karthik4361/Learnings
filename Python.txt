Lambda functions are singe line  and  should return some value used when we need a function for less time and don’t need it later. 

Set -   .add(element) adds element
	.remove(element) removes element if found if not error
	.discard(element) removes element if found if not it won’t raise error
	All these are O(1) but in worse case of collisions in Hash table its O(n)
Dictionary : 
		.get(key, default) - will give you value for key in dict if key not present it will return the value we pass in default
		All these are O(1) but in worse case of collisions in Hash table its O(n)

Default Dict:   The main advantage of a defaultdict is that it avoids the "KeyError" that typically occurs when trying to access or modify a non-existent key in a regular dictionary. Instead of raising an 		error, a defaultdict automatically creates the key and assigns it a default value specified during the creation of the dictionary.

Usage - from collections import defaultdict
	my_dict = defaultdict(default_value_factory)
